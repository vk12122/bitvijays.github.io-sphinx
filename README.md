Welcome to the **Git-Repo** of bitvijays.github.io

Currently, there are **three series** published:

## The Essential Series:

This series covers the essentials required to be in the field of Cyber-Security.

* [**CyberSecurity in an Enterprise**](https://github.com/bitvijays/bitvijays.github.io-sphinx/blob/master/docs/LFF-ESS-P0A-CyberSecurityEnterprise.rst) : This blog is about the cybersecurity in an Enterprise? We would start with a simple concept of two people \( Alice and Bob \) starting a new company and building it to Micro \( &lt; 10 employees \), Small \( &lt; 50 employees \), Medium-sized \( &lt; 250 employees \), larger with security breachs, vulnerablitiy assessments happening. We would mention a story, what all devices are required with what security etc.
* [**Linux Basics**](https://github.com/bitvijays/bitvijays.github.io-sphinx/blob/master/docs/LFF-ESS-P0B-LinuxEssentials.rst) : This post lists essential commands and concepts which would be helpful to a Linux user. We would cover tools required for programming \( Vi, git \), system administration \( Bash configuration files, Updating Debian Linux System, Adding/Deleting/Modifying Users/Groups, Changing Group/Owner/Permission, Mounting/Unmounting, Linux Directories, Runlevels and Kernel Configurations \).

## Infrastructure Pentest Series:

This series cover all the phases of Infrastructure Pentest as described in Pentest-Standard.org

* [**Intelligence Gathering**](https://github.com/bitvijays/bitvijays.github.io-sphinx/blob/master/docs/LFF-IPS-P1-IntelligenceGathering.rst) : This post would list the technical steps which might be important while doing the information gathering of an organization and we only know the company name or itâ€™s domain name such as example.com
* [**Vulnerability Analysis**](https://github.com/bitvijays/bitvijays.github.io-sphinx/blob/master/docs/LFF-IPS-P2-VulnerabilityAnalysis.rst) : This post would cover different options available to explore and exploit different services running on different ports by utilizing metasploit-fu and nmap or other tools.
* [**Exploitation**](https://github.com/bitvijays/bitvijays.github.io-sphinx/blob/master/docs/LFF-IPS-P3-Exploitation.rst) : This post would provide a overview of different methods of enumeration once we have access to credentials of a domain user of windows domain and multiple ways to execute remote commands on the remote machine once we have administrative credentials.
* [**Post Exploitation**](https://github.com/bitvijays/bitvijays.github.io-sphinx/blob/master/docs/LFF-IPS-P4-PostExploitation.rst) : In this post, we will explore multiple methods of gathering credentials after getting a administrative remote shell. We would also have explore multiple ways to have a High-Impact post exploitation which leaves an impact to the higher mangagement of the organization. 
* [**Reporting**](https://github.com/bitvijays/bitvijays.github.io-sphinx/blob/master/docs/LFF-IPS-P5-Reporting.rst) : This post would provide different open-source ways to automate report writing after the Pentest.

## Capture the flag Series

Series covers the learning obtained by solving the Capture the flag \(CTF\) challenges

* [**Vulnerable Machines**](https://github.io/bitvijays/bitvijays.github.io-sphinx/blob/master/docs/LFC-VulnerableMachines.rst) : Knowledge gained by solving/ reading write-ups of vulnerable machines provided by the VulnHub, Hack the Box etc.
* [**Binary Exploitation**](https://github.com/bitvijays/bitvijays.github.io-sphinx/blob/master/docs/LFC-BinaryExploitation.rst) : Knowledge gained by solving/ reading write-ups of binary exploitation challenges.
